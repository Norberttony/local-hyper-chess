// The move class contains all relevant information about any move...
//  - "to"          is a square index of where the moving piece is going to
//  - "from"        is a square index of where the moving piece is moving from
//  - "captures"    is an array of {square, captured} where "square" is the location of the
//                      captured piece and "captured" is the piece itself.
